Suggestions for Refinements:

Primary Color (#00a896):

Works excellently as a base or key UI element color.
Calming yet vibrant, suitable for call-to-actions or headers.

Secondary Color (#f0f3bd):

Ideal for backgrounds or complementary areas.
Provides a soft, non-distracting contrast to the primary color.

Neutral Complement:

Adding a neutral like #ffffff (white) for clean spaces or #4a4a4a (dark gray) for text ensures readability without overstimulation.

Accent Colors:

Consider #ff6f61 (soft coral) or #f7c857 (warm yellow) as accents for highlights or small attention-grabbing areas.
Button Hover Color:

For button hover effects, a slightly darker or complementary shade works best:

Darker Teal: #00867a (adds subtle depth without straying far from the primary color).
Contrasting Pop: #f4a261 (muted orange) or #f7c857 (warm yellow) for an energetic touch.

These hover effects enhance engagement without overwhelming users visually. Let me know if youâ€™d like specific examples of how to implement these in CSS!
